# demo-binarytree-bfs
This is an implementation of breadth-first-search on a binarytree data structure. It outputs the number of times the characters of a given word must be swapped to get another given word which is an anagram of the former. The condition here is that no more than one swap can take place per time.

For instances, given "GUMSORE" as an input and "ROSEGUM" as the desired output, the result will be: ```8 adjacent words were swapped, 3 binary trees were formed.```
Going the other way, from ""ROSEGUM" to "GUMSORE", theresult will be: ```15 adjacent words were swapped, 5 binary trees were formed.```
